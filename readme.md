# Shift Codes Shortcut

This extension makes redeeming your Borderlands Shift codes faster and easier than ever.  If you find a Shift Code on the web, just select it, and then right-click and select `Redeem Shift Code`.

A new Chrome tab will be opened to `https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/rewards`, the shift code will be pasted into the `shift_code_input` input, and the form will be submitted.

## Assumptions

This is a very simple Chrome extension.  It does not track behavior, and it does not handle any credentials.  In order for this to work, the extension assumes that you have already logged into `https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/rewards`.  Note: GearBox will remember your login, so if you've logged in once, you don't have to log in every time.
